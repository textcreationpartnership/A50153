            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

About this time it was, that Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> grew into a most intimate Acquaintance with Mr. <hi>Rogers</hi> of <hi>Dedham;</hi> who so highly valued him for his Multifarious Abilities, that he used and gained many Endeavours to get him Settled at <hi>Colchester;</hi> whereto Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> did very much Incline, because of its being so near to <hi>Dedham,</hi> where he might Enjoy the <hi>Labours</hi> &amp; <hi>Lectures</hi> of Mr. <hi>Rogers,</hi> whome he would some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times call, <hi>The Prince of all the Preachers in En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland.</hi> But the Providence of God gave an Obstruction to that Settlement; and, indeed, it was an Observation, which Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> would sometimes afterwards use unto his Friends, <hi>That the Providence of God often Divirted him from Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment in such Places, as he himself Desired, and still Directed him to such Flaces, as he had no thoughts of.</hi> Accordingly, <hi>Chelmsford</hi> in <hi>Essex,</hi> a Town of great Concourse, wanting one to <hi>Break the Bread of Life</hi> unto them; and hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Fame of Mr. <hi>Hooker's</hi> Powerful Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry; Addressed him to become their <hi>Lecturer:</hi> and he accepted their Offer about the Year 1626. becoming not only their <hi>Lecturer,</hi> but also on the Lord's Dayes, an <hi>Assistent</hi> unto one Mr. <hi>Mitchel,</hi> the Incumbent of the Place; who though he were a <hi>Smaller,</hi> yet being a <hi>Godly</hi> Person, gladly Encouraged Mr. <hi>Hooker,</hi> &amp; Liv'd with him in a most Comfortable Amity.</p>
            <pb n="9" facs="tcp:41694:29"/>
            <p>Â§. 6. Here his Lecture was exceedingly Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quented, and proportionably Succeeded; and the Light of his Ministry shone through the whole County of <hi>Essex.</hi> There was a rare mixture of <hi>Pleasure</hi> and <hi>Profit</hi> in his Preaching; and his Hearers felt those penetrating Impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of his Ministry upon their Souls, which caused them to Reverence him, as, <hi>A Teacher sent from God.</hi> He had a most excellent Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty at the <hi>Applications</hi> of his Doctrine; and he would therein so Touch the <hi>Consciences</hi> of his Auditors, that a Judicious Person would say of him, <hi>He was the Best at an Use that ever he Heard.</hi> Hereby there was a great Reformation wrought, not only in the <hi>Town,</hi> but in the Adjacent <hi>Countrey;</hi> from all parts whereof they came to <hi>Hear the Wisdom of the Lord Jesus Christ,</hi> in His Gospel, by this worthy man Dispensed: and some of great Quality among the rest, would often Resort from far to his Assembly; parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly the truly Noble Earl of <hi>Warwick,</hi> whose Countenance of Good Ministers, procured more <hi>Prayers</hi> to God for him, than most Noble Men in <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When he first Set up his Lecture, there was more <hi>Prophaneness</hi> than <hi>Devotion</hi> in the Town: and the Multitode of <hi>Inns</hi> and <hi>Shops</hi> in the Town produced one particular Disorder, of Peoples filling the Streets with unsuitable Beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:41694:30"/> after the Publick Services of the <hi>Lords-Day</hi> were over. But by the Power of his <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry</hi> in Publick, and by the Prudence of his Carriage in Private, he quickly cleared the Streets of this Disorder, and the <hi>Sabbath</hi> came to be very visibly Sanctified among the People.</p>
            <p>Â§. 7. The <hi>Joy</hi> of the People in this <hi>Light was but for a Season.</hi> The Conscientious Non-Conformity of M. <hi>Hooker</hi> to some Rites of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> then vigorously pressed, especially upon such Able and Useful Ministers, as were most likely to be Laid aside by their scrupling of those Rites; made it necessary for him to Lay down his Ministry in <hi>Chelmsford,</hi> when he had been about four years there, Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in it. Hereupon, at the Request of several Eminent Persons, he kept a <hi>School,</hi> in <hi>his own Hired House,</hi> having our Mr. <hi>John Eliot</hi> for his <hi>Usher,</hi> at little <hi>Baddow</hi> not far from <hi>Chelmsford;</hi> where he managed his Charge with such Discretion, such Authority, and such Effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy, that, able to do more with a <hi>Word,</hi> or a <hi>Look,</hi> than most other men could have done by a <hi>Severer Discipline,</hi> he did very great <hi>Service</hi> to the Church of God, in the Education of such, as afterwards proved themselves not a little <hi>Serviceable.</hi> I have in my Hands, a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuscript, written by the Hands of our Blessed ELIOT, wherein he gives a very <hi>Great</hi> Account
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:41694:30"/> of the Little <hi>Academy</hi> then mentained in the <hi>House</hi> of Mr. <hi>Hooker;</hi> and among other things, he says, <hi>To this place I was call'd, through the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Kiches of Gods Mercy in Christ Jesus to my poor Soul: For here the Lord said unto my Dead Soul,</hi> Live; <hi>and through the Grace of Christ, I do Live, and I shall Live for ever! When I came to this Blessed Family, I then saw, and never before, the Power of Godliness, in its Lively Vigour and Efficdey.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Â§. 8. While he continued thus in the <hi>Heart</hi> of <hi>Essex,</hi> and in the <hi>Hearts</hi> of the People there, he signalized his <hi>Usefulness</hi> in many other Instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>
            <p>The Godly Ministers round about the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, would have Recourse unto him, to be Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected and Resolved, in their <hi>Difficult Cases:</hi> and it was by his means that those Godly Ministers held their <hi>Montbly Meetings</hi> for <hi>Fasting</hi> and <hi>Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,</hi> and profitable <hi>Conferences.</hi> 'Twas the Effect of his <hi>Consultations</hi> also, that such Godly Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, came to be here and there Settled in several parts of the County; and many others came to be better establish'd in some great points of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stanity, by being in his Neighbourhood and Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance. He was indeed, a <hi>General Blessing</hi> to the Church of God! But that which bin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred his Taking his Degree of <hi>Batchelour in Divinity,</hi> must also it seems hinder his being a

               <hi>Preacher of Divinity;</hi> namely his being a <hi>Non-Conformist</hi> unto some things, whereof true <hi>Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi> could not approve. And indeed that which made the Silencing of Mr. <hi>Hooker,</hi> more unaccountable was, That no less than <hi>Seven and Forty</hi> Conformable Ministers of the Neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

Whence, though the <hi>Ready</hi> and <hi>Noisy</hi> Performances of many Preachers, when they are as <hi>Plato</hi> speaks, THEATROU MESTOI, or <hi>Full of the Theatre,</hi> Acting to the Height in the Publick for their Applause, may be ascribed unto very <hi>Mechanical Principles;</hi> yet the <hi>vigour</hi> in the Ministry of our <hi>Hooker,</hi> being Raised by a <hi>Coal from the Altar</hi> of a most Real Devotion, touching his <hi>Heart;</hi> it would be a wrong unto the Good <hi>Spirit</hi> of our God, if <hi>He</hi> should not be Acknowledged the Author of it. That <hi>Spirit</hi> accordingly gave a wonderful and unusual <hi>Success,</hi> unto the Ministry wherein he <hi>Breathed</hi> so Remarkably. Of that <hi>Success</hi> there were many Instances; but one par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly I find mentioned in <hi>Clark</hi>'s Examples, to this purpose. A profane person, Designing therein only an Ungodly Diversion and Merri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, said unto his Companions, <hi>Come, Let us go Hear, what that Bawling</hi> Hooker <hi>will say to
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:41694:32"/> us;</hi> and thereupon with an Intention to make sport, unto <hi>Chelmsford</hi> Lecture they came. The man had not been long in the Church, before the <hi>Quick and Powerful Word</hi> of God, in the mouth of His Faithful <hi>Hooker,</hi> pierced the Soul of him; he came out with an Awakened and a Distressed Soul, and by the further Blessing of God upon Mr. <hi>Hooker's</hi> Ministry, he arrived unto a true <hi>Conversion;</hi> for which cause he would not afterwards Leave that Blessed Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry, but went a <hi>Thousand Leagues</hi> to Attend it, and Enjoy it. Another Memorable Thing of this kind, was this; It was Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi>'s manner once a year to visit his Native County: and in one of those Visits, he had an Invitation to Preach in the Great Church of <hi>Leicester.</hi> One of the chief Burgesses in the Town, much Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed his Preaching there; and when he could not prevail to hinder it, he set certain <hi>Fidl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Â§ 11. The <hi>Spiritual Court,</hi> Sitting at <hi>Chelmsford,</hi> about the year 1630. had not only Sileneed Mr. <hi>Hooker,</hi> but also bound him over in a Bond of <hi>Fifty Pound,</hi> to appear before the <hi>High Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> which he could not now attend, because of an <hi>Ague</hi> then upon him. One of his Hearers, namely Mr. <hi>Nash,</hi> a very honest Yeoman, that Rented a great Farm of the Earl of <hi>Warwick,</hi> at <hi>Much-Waltham,</hi> was Bound in that Sum for his Appearance; but as <hi>Paul</hi> was advised by his Friends, that he would not venture into the Theatre at <hi>Ephesus,</hi> thus Mr. Hooker's Friends advised him to Forfeit his Bonds, rather than throw himself any further into the Hands of his Enemies. Wherefore, when the Day for his Appearance came, his honest Surety being Reimbursed by several good People in and near <hi>Chelmsford,</hi> sent in the forfeited Sum into the Court; and Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> having, by the Earl of <hi>Warwick,</hi> a courteous and private Recess pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for his Family, at a place called <hi>Old Park,</hi> for which I find, the Thanks of Dr. <hi>Hil</hi> afterwards publickly given in his Dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of Mr. <hi>Fenners</hi> Treatise about <hi>Impenitency;</hi> He went over to <hi>Holland.</hi> In his Passage
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:41694:33"/> thither, he quickly had Occasion to Discover himself, when they were in Fminent Hazzard of <hi>Shipwrack,</hi> upon a Shelf of Sand, whereon they Ran in the Night; but Mr. <hi>Hooker,</hi> like <hi>Paul</hi> again, with a Remarkable <hi>Confidence,</hi> Aslu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red them, that they should be all Preserved; and they had as Remarkable a <hi>Deliverance.</hi> I have also heard, that when he fled from the Pursevants, to take his Passage for the <hi>Low-Count treyes.</hi> at his Last Parting with some of his Friends, one of them said, <hi>Sir, What if the Wind should not be fair, when you come to the Vessel?</hi> whereto he instantly replyed, <hi>Brother, Let us Leave that with Him, who keeps the Wind in the Hollow of his Hand:</hi> And it was observ'd, That although the Wind was Cross, until <hi>be</hi> came Aboard, yet it immediately then came about fair and fresh, and he was no sooner under Sail, but the Officer arriv'd at the Sea-side, hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily too Late now to conie at him: which minds me, of what besel Dr. <hi>Goodwin,</hi> not Long after. That Great man, Lay <hi>Wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound,</hi> in hourly suspicions that the Purse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants would stop his Voyage, and Seiz his Person, before the <hi>Wird</hi> would favour his getting away for <hi>Holland.</hi> In this Distress, Humbly Praying to the Lord Jesus Christ, for a more propitious <hi>Wind,</hi> he yet said, <hi>Lord, If thou hast at this time, any poor Servant of thine, that wants this Wind, more than I do another, I do not ask for
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:41694:34"/> the Changing of it; I submit unto it.</hi> And imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately the Wind came about, unto the Right Point; and carried him clear from his Pursu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.</p>

               <hi>Hookers</hi> Reason; Declaring, that <hi>though he had, been Acquainted with many Scholars of divers Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, yet he never met with Mr.</hi> Hookers <hi>Equal, either for Preaching or for Disputing.</hi> But having tarried in <hi>Holland</hi> long enough to see the State of Religion in the Churches there, he became satisfied, that it was neither Eligible for <hi>him</hi> to tarry in that Country, nor Convenient for <hi>his Friends</hi> to be Invited thither after him.

            <p>
               <hi>It is not Gold and Prosperity, which makes God to be our God; there is more Gold in the</hi> West Indies, <hi>than there is in all</hi> Christendom; <hi>but it is Gods Ordinances in the virtue of them, that show the Presence of God.</hi>

            <p>Once more, England <hi>hath seen her Best Dayes, and now Evil Dayes are befalling us.</hi>

            <p>And, <hi>Thou</hi> England, <hi>which hast been Lifted up to Heaven with Means, shall be Abased and brought down to Hell; for if the mighty works, which have been Done in Thee, had been Done in</hi> India <hi>or</hi> Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>key, <hi>they would have Repented ere this.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These Passages I quote, that I may the more effectually Describe the Apprehensions, with which this Worthy man took his <hi>Farewel</hi> of his Native Countrey.</p>
            <p>Â§. 16. Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> and Mr. <hi>Cotton</hi> were, for their different <hi>Genius,</hi> the <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Melancthon</hi> of <hi>New-England;</hi> at their Ar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

Inexpressible now was the Joy of Mr. <hi>Hooker,</hi> to find himself Surrounded with his Friends, who were come over the year before, to prepare for
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:41694:37"/> his Reception; with open arms he Embraced them, and uttered these words, <hi>Now I Live, if you stand stast in the Lord.</hi> But such multitudes flocked over to <hi>New England</hi> after them, that the Plantation of <hi>New-Town</hi> became too straight for them; and it was Mr. <hi>Hookers</hi> Advice that they should not Incur the Danger of a <hi>Sitna,</hi> or an <hi>Esek,</hi> where they might have a <hi>Rehoboth.</hi> Acco<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>dingly in the Month of <hi>June</hi> 1636. they Removed an Hundred miles to the Westward, with a purpose to Settle upon the Delightful Banks of <hi>Connecticut River:</hi> and there were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout an Hundred Persons in the first Company that made this Removal, who not being able to Walk above ten miles a Day, took up near a Fortnight in the Journey; having no Pillows to take their Nightly Rest upon, but such as their Father <hi>Jacob</hi> found in the way to <hi>Padan-Aram.</hi> Here Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> was the chief Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Beginning</hi> another Colony, as Mr. <hi>Cotton,</hi> whom he Left behind him, was, of <hi>Preserving</hi> and <hi>Perfecting</hi> that Colony where he Left him; for, indeed each of them were the <hi>Oracle</hi> of their several Colonies.</p>
            <p>Â§ 17. Though Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> had thus Remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from the <hi>Massachusett-Bay,</hi> yet he sometimes came down to visit the Churches in that Bay; But when ever he came, he was Received with an Affection, like that which <hi>Paul</hi> found among
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:41694:37"/> the <hi>Galatians;</hi> yea, 'tis thought, that once there seemed some Intimation from Heaven, as if the Good People had <hi>Overdone</hi> in that Affection. For on <hi>May</hi> 26. 1639. Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> being here to Preach that Lords Day in the Afternoon, his great Fame had gathered a vast multitude of Hearers from several other Congregations, and among the Rest, the Governour himself, to be made Partakers of his Ministry. But when he came to Preach, he found himself so unaccoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably at a Loss, that after some shattered and broken Attempts, to proceed, he made a full stop; saying to the Assembly, <hi>That every thingâ–ª which be would have spoken, was taken both out of his Mouth, and out of his Mind also;</hi> wherefore he Desired them to Sing a <hi>Psalm,</hi> while he withdrew about half an Hour from them: Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning then to the Congregation, he Preached a most admirable Sermon, wherein he Held them for two Hours together in an extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Strain, both of <hi>Pertinency</hi> and <hi>Vivacity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After Sermon, when some of his Friends were speaking of the Lords thus <hi>Withdrawing</hi> His Assistences from him, he humbly replied, <hi>We daily confess, that we have nothing, and can do nothing, without Christ; and what if Christ will make this manifest in us, and on us, before our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations? what remains, but that we be humbly Contented? and what manner of Discouragement is there in all of this?</hi> Thus Content was <hi>he</hi>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:41694:38"/> to be <hi>Nullified,</hi> that the LORD might be <hi>Magnified!</hi>

            <p>Â§ 18. Mr. <hi>Hooker,</hi> that had been Born to <hi>Serve many,</hi> and was of such a Publick Spirit, that I find him occasionally Celebrated, in the Life of Mr. <hi>Angier,</hi> Lately Published, for One, Who would be continually Inquisitive, how it Fared with the Church of God, both at home and abroad, on purpose that he might order his <hi>Prayers</hi> and <hi>Cares</hi> accordingly: <hi>He</hi> never took his Opportunity to <hi>Serve himself;</hi> but Lived a sort of <hi>Exile</hi> all his Dayes, except the Last Fourteen Years of his Lite, among his own <hi>Spiritual Children</hi> at <hi>Hartford;</hi> however, here also, he was an <hi>Exile.</hi> Accordingly, wherever he came, he Lived like a <hi>Stranger</hi> in the World! When at the Lands-End, he took his last sight of <hi>England,</hi> he said, <hi>Farewel</hi> England! <hi>I expect now no more to see that Religious Zeal, and Power of Godliness, which I have seen among Professors in that Land!</hi> And he had Sagacious and Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Apprehensions of the Declensions which would attend <hi>Reforming Churches,</hi> when they came to Enjoy a place of <hi>Liberty:</hi> he said, <hi>That Adversity had slain its Thousands, but Prosperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty would stay its Ten Thousands!</hi> he fear'd, <hi>That they who had been Lively Christians in the Fire of Persecution, would soon become cold in the midst of Universal Peace, except some few, whom God by
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:41694:38"/> sharp Tryals, would keep in a Faithful, Watchful, Humble and Praying Frame.</hi> But under these Preapprehensions, it was his own Endeavour to beware of Abating his own <hi>First Love!</hi> And of so <hi>Watchful,</hi> so <hi>Prayerful,</hi> so <hi>Fruitful</hi> a Spirit was Mr. <hi>Hooker,</hi> that the <hi>Spirit of Prophecy</hi> it self, did seem to grant him some singular <hi>Afflations.</hi> Indeed, every <hi>Wise man</hi> is a <hi>Prophet;</hi> but one so Eminently acquainted with <hi>Scripture</hi> and <hi>Reason,</hi> and <hi>Church-History,</hi> as our <hi>Hooker,</hi> must needs be a <hi>Seer,</hi> from whom singular <hi>Prognostica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> were to be expected. Accordingly, there were many things <hi>Prognosticated</hi> by him, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Future State of <hi>New England,</hi> particularly of <hi>Connecticut,</hi> has been so much concerned, that its pitty they should be forgotten. But I will in this History, Record only Two of his Predictions. One was, <hi>That God would punish the wanton Spirit of the Professers, in this Countrey, with a sad want of Able Men in all Orders.</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother was, <hi>That in certain places of great Light here Sinned againss, there would break forth such horrible Sins, us would be the Amazement of the World.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Â§ 19. He was a <hi>Man of Prayer,</hi> which was indeed, a ready way to become a <hi>Man of God.</hi> He would say, <hi>That Prayer was the principal part of a Ministers Work; 'twas by this, that he was to carry on the Rest.</hi> Accordingly, he still Devoted
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:41694:39"/>
               <hi>One Day</hi> in a <hi>Month,</hi> to Private <hi>Prayer</hi> with <hi>Fasting</hi> before the Lord, besides the <hi>Publick Fasts</hi> which often occurred unto him. He would say, <hi>That such Extraordinary Favours, as the Life of Religion, and the Power of Godliness, must be preserved by the frequent Use of such Extraordinary Means, as</hi> Prayer <hi>with</hi> Fasting; <hi>and that if Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors grow negligent of these Means, Iniquity will Abound, and the Love of many wax cold.</hi> Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless in the Duty of <hi>Prayer,</hi> he affected <hi>Strength,</hi> rather than <hi>Length;</hi> and though he had not so much variety in his <hi>Publick Praying,</hi> as in his <hi>Publick Preaching,</hi> yet he alwayes had a seasonable Respect unto Present Occasions. And it was Observed, that his <hi>Prayer</hi> was usually like <hi>Jacobs</hi> Ladder, wherein the nearer he came to an <hi>End,</hi> the nearer he drew towards <hi>Heaven;</hi> and he grew into such Rapturous <hi>Pleadings</hi> with God, and <hi>Praysings</hi> of God, as made some to say, <hi>That Like the Master of the Feast, he Reserved the best Wine until the Last.</hi> Nor was the wonderful <hi>Success</hi> of his <hi>Prayer</hi> upon special Concerns, unobserved by the whole Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony; who Reckoned him the <hi>Moses,</hi> which <hi>Turned away the Wrath of God from them,</hi> and obtained a <hi>Blast</hi> from Heaven upon their Indian <hi>Amalekites,</hi> by his <hi>Uplifted Hands,</hi> in those Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable Deliverances which they sometimes experienced. It was very particularly observed, when there was a Battel to be Fought between
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:41694:39"/> the <hi>Narraganset,</hi> and the <hi>Monbegin</hi> Indians, in the year 1643. The <hi>Narraganset</hi> Indians had Complotted the Ruine of the English, but the <hi>Monbegin</hi> were Confederate with us; and a War now being between those two Nations, much notice was taken of the prevailing Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity, wherewith Mr. <hi>Hooker,</hi> urged for the Accomplishment of that Great Promise unto the People of God, <hi>I will Bless Bless them that Bless thee, but I will Curse him that Curses thee.</hi> And the Effect of it was, that the <hi>Narragansets</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a wonderful Overthrow from the <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>begins,</hi> though the former did three or four to one, for Number, exceed the latter. Such an <hi>Israel at Prayer</hi> was our <hi>Hooker!</hi> And this Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Pastor</hi> was Blessed, as indeed such Ministers use to be, with a Praying <hi>People;</hi> there fell up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on His pious <hi>people,</hi> a <hi>Double Portion</hi> of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> which they beheld in him.</p>
            <p>Â§. 20. That Reverend and Excellent Man, Mr. <hi>Whitfield,</hi> having spent many years in Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dying of <hi>Books,</hi> did at length take two or three years to Study <hi>Men;</hi> And in pursuance of this Design, having Acquainted himself with the most Considerable Divines in <hi>England,</hi> at last he fell into the Acquaintance of Mr. <hi>Hooker;</hi> concerning whom, he afterwards gave this Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony; 'That he had not thought there had been such a man on Earth; a man in whom
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:41694:40"/> there Shone so many Excellencies, as were in this <hi>Incomparable</hi> Hooker; <hi>A man in whom Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and Wisdom, were so Tempered with Zeal, Holiness and Watchfulness.</hi> And the same Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>server, having exactly Noted Mr. <hi>Hooker,</hi> made this Remark, and gave this Report, more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly of him, <hi>That he had the best Command of his own Spirit, which he ever saw in any man whatever.</hi> For though he were a man of a Cholerick Disposition, and had a mighty Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour and Fervour of Spirit, which as Occasion served, was wondrous useful unto him, yet he had ordinarily as much Government of his Choler, as a man has of a <hi>Mastiff Dog</hi> in a Chain; <hi>He could Let out his Dog, and put in his Dog, as he pleased.</hi> And another, that observed the Heroical Spirit and Courage, with which this Great man, Fulfilled his Ministry, gave this Account or him, <hi>He was a person, who whi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="32" facs="tcp:41694:41"/> all sorts of persons, in their Discourses with him, to Reap the Benesit of the Extraordinary Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, which himself had found of <hi>Satan's Devices.</hi> Once particularly; Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> was Addressed by a Student in Divinity, who En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring upon his Ministry was, as the most <hi>Useful Ministers,</hi> at their Entrance thereupon, use to be, horribly Buffered with <hi>Temptations,</hi> which were become almost <hi>Intollerable:</hi> Repairing to Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> in the Distresses and Anguishes of his Mind, and Bemoaning his own overwhelming <hi>Fears,</hi> while the <hi>Lion</hi> was thus Roaring at him, Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> answered, <hi>I can compare with any man Living for</hi> Fears! <hi>My Advice to you is, That you Search out and Analyse the humbling Causes of them, and Refer them to their proper places; then go and pour them out before the Lord; and they shall prove more profitable to you than any</hi> Books <hi>you can Read.</hi> But Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> in his Dealing with Troubled Consciences, observed, that there were a sort of <hi>Crafty</hi> and <hi>Guileful</hi> Souls, which he would find out with an Admirable Dexteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and of these he would say, as <hi>Paul</hi> of the <hi>Cretians, They must be Reproved sharply, that they may be Sound in the Faith; Sharp Rebukes make Sound Christians.</hi> Indeed, <hi>of some be had Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion, making a Difference; and others he Saved with fear, pulling them out of the Fire.</hi>

            <p>Â§. 23. Although he had a Notable Hand
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:41694:41"/> at the Discussing and Adjusting of <hi>Controversal</hi> Points, yet he would hardly ever handle any <hi>Polemical Divinity</hi> in the Pulpit; but the very <hi>Spirit</hi> of his Ministry lay in the points of the most <hi>Practical Religion,</hi> and the <hi>Grand Concerns</hi> of a Sinner's <hi>Preparation</hi> for, <hi>Implantation</hi> in, and <hi>Salvation</hi> by, the Glorious Lord Jesus Christ. And in these Discourses he would frequently Intermix, most affectionate Warnings of the <hi>Declensions,</hi> which would quickly Befal the Churches and Christians of <hi>New-England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Many Volumns of the Sermons Preached by him were since Printed; and this Account is to be given of them.</p>
            <p>While he was Fellow of <hi>Immanuel. Colledge,</hi> he entertained a special Inclination to those Principles of Divinity, which concerned, <hi>The Application of Redemption;</hi> and that which emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently fitted him for the Handling of those Principles, was, That he had been from his Youth Trained up, in the Experience of these <hi>Humiliations</hi> and <hi>Consolations,</hi> and Sacred <hi>Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niont,</hi> which belong to the New Creature; and he had most critically compared his own Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, with the Accounts, which the <hi>Quick and Powerful Word of God,</hi> gives of those Glorious Things. Accordingly, he Preached, first more briefly on these <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="34" facs="tcp:41694:42"/> and the Notes of what he then Delivered were so Esteemed, that many Copies thereof were Transcribed and P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

Afterwards, he Preached more largely on those Points, in a more <hi>popular way</hi> at <hi>Chelmsford,</hi> the Product of which were those Books of <hi>Praeparation for Christ, Contrition, Humiliation, Vocation, Union with Christ, and Communion,</hi> and the rest, which go under his Name; for many wrote after him in <hi>Short-Hand;</hi> and some were so bold, as to Publish many of them, without his Confent or Knowledge; whereby his Notions came to be Deformed<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>y misrepresented in multitudes of Passages; among which I will suppose that Crude Passage, which Mr. <hi>Giles Firmin,</hi> in his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 span">

               <hi>Christian,</hi> so well confutes, <hi>That if the Soul be rightly Humbled, it is content to bear the State of Damnation.</hi> But when he came to <hi>New England,</hi> many of his Church, which had been his Old <hi>Essex</hi> Hearers, desired him once more to go over the Points of <hi>God's Regenerating Works upon the Souls of His Elect;</hi> until, at last their Desires prevailed with him to Resume that pleasant Subject. The Subject hereby came to have a <hi>Third Concotion,</hi> in the Head and Heart of One, as able to Digest it, as most men Living in the World; and it was his Design to perfect with his own Hand his Composures for the Press, and thereby Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate both <hi>Author</hi> and <hi>Matter,</hi> from the
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:41694:42"/> wrongs done to <hi>both,</hi> by Surreptitious <hi>Editions</hi> heretofore. He did not Live to finish what he intended; yet a Worthy Minister, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Mr. <hi>John Higginson,</hi> One richly able himself to have been an <hi>Author</hi> of a not unlike <hi>Matter,</hi> Transcribed from his <hi>Manuscripts,</hi> near two Hundred of these Excellent Sermons, which were sent over into <hi>England,</hi> that they might be Published; but, by what means I know not, scarce half of them have seen the Light unto this Day. However, 'tis possible, the valuableness of those that are Published, may at some time or other awaken some Enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries after the <hi>Unknown Hands</hi> wherein the restâ–ª are as yet concealed.</p>
            <p>Â§. 24. But this was not all the Service, which the Pen of Mr. <hi>Hooker,</hi> did for the Church of God! It was his Opinion, That there were <hi>Two great Reserves of Enquiry,</hi> for this Age of the World; the First, Where<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">

The Second, After what Order the <hi>Government</hi> of our, Lord's Kingdom is to be <hi>Externally</hi> Managed and Maintained in his Churches?

In his Administration of <hi>Church-Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cioline</hi> there were several Things, as <hi>I mitable,</hi> as <hi>Observable.</hi> As he was an hearty Friend unto the <hi>Consociation of Churches;</hi> and hence all the time, that he Lived, the <hi>Pastors</hi> of the Nighbouring Churches, held their frequent Meetings for mutual Consultation in things of common Concernment; so, in his own <hi>particular Church,</hi> he was very careful, to have every thing done with a Christian <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration,</hi> and <hi>Unanimity.</hi> Wherefore he would have nothing publickly propounded unto the <hi>Brethren</hi> of the Church, but what had been first privately prepared by the <hi>Elders;</hi> and if he feared the happening of any <hi>Debate,</hi> his way aforehand w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

As
